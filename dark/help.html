          <h1 class="help-title">Here is some brief information to help you get started</h1>
        <p>
          The first step is to register on our site. This is free both for men and women.
          Only registered members can contact other members of our site.
        </p>
        <p>
          After registration you will get an account on our server where you can check your mail, keep track of mail sent, members contacted, credits purchased and spent.

        </p>
        <p>
          Once registered you can contact other members of our site:

        </p>
            <h1 class="help-title">How exactly do I contact other members and communicate with them?</h1>

            <p>You can send messages for free to any member, as long as their profile is active, and you don’t have more than one unopened message from them. You send messages in English and you will receive replies also in English, even if your party does not speak English. Your messages and your party's replies will be handled by the staff of a local dating agency who will translate and deliver the messages back and forth. They may forward the translation to the lady by email or instant messanger, or read it over the telephone, or the lady may stop by the agency to check her messages and have them and her responses translated. This is all done behind the scenes, you do not need to do anything. You will simply receive a reply in your Inbox, in English and can reply right away, also in English. You will be notified by email every time you get a new message. If you don’t want to receive these notifications at your main email address, we suggest you use another email address for your profile. Also in your profile settings you can choose to receive these notifications once per day for all messages, as opposed to receiving them immediately for each message individually. If you don’t want to receive notifications from new women, you can change the status of your profile to Invisible, but note that in this case new women can not contact you, and your profile will not show up in search results, but you will stil be able to continue all existing correspondence. To stop receiving all notifications completely, you can change your profile to Suspended, which will make your profile basically inactive and will terminate all existing correspondence as well. All your previous messages will be saved and you can reactivate your profile at any time later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until you write to a lady for the first time, her messages are free to open. After you write to a woman and if she responds, you will have to pay a fixed price per message for the translation of your correspondence.

            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't feel like writing a letter, you can send them a free "smile".

            </p>
            <p>
              A smile is a quick "Hi" message with a link back to your profile which indicates to a member your interest in him or her.

            </p>
            <p>
              Or you can place a live interpreted phone call or even a video call directly with her via our bi-lingual operator.

            </p>
            <p>
              You’ll need to contact us at least 24 hours in advance and tell us which lady you want to talk to, and at what time. Our interpreter will do the rest
            </p>
            <h1 class="help-title">
              Why does the price of translation differ from lady to lady?
            </h1>
            <p>
              We don't want to complicate things for you by charging for the translation per word as is mostly done in translation industry. Instead you pay one fixed fee for the translation of each pair of messages that you exchange, regardless how long or short they are.

            </p>
            <p>
              However that fixed fee may vary depending on the lady you are corresponding with. The problem with all dating sites is that the vast majority of men will want to correspond with a handful of most popular women and vice versa.If one woman receives letters from dozens of men, while others receive no letters at all, that's not good for anybody.So, to mitigate this, our system automacally rises the price for translation for those ladies who receive the most attention, to discourage new contacts.This only applies to new contacts, so if you are already corresponding with her, your translation price will not increase.If a lady becomes too popular, with too many letters going unanswered and a further price increase is no longer practical, her profile is omitted from search results, although the men she is already in contact with will still be able to correspond with her, and their price for translation will not go up.

            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that the lower price for translation does not mean the lady is by any means inferior to those with higher price for translation. It just means fewer men have already contacted her, which could be caused by the fact that she has just recently joined the site, or her profile is showing lower in the search results, or she has chosen to put more conservative pictures in her profile,or other reasons. Everyone deserves attention, and we want all our members to be active, so we strongly enocourage men to write to women with lower price for translation.
